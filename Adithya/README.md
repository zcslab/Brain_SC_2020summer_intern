#         Development of a Single Cell RNA Sequencing data based Testbed for studying brain diseases.
#                         (Data Analysis Project â€“ using R programming)


Project Overview:
Develop a series of computational methods and derive  some knowledge of the role of disease-specific cell features in different human diseases. 
Need a computational framework with a pipeline and web-server that can be used to study a broader set of disease types. The knowledge derived can be used to build a database.

# Single cell RNA sequencing
  1.  Measures the distribution of expression levels for each gene across a population of cells.
  2.  Study of Cell Specific changes in transcriptome eg.cell type identification.
